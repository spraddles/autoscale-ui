Tasks:
- add support for min/max font size scaling
- add support to auto-scale the font size to fit text within a fixed width & fixed height box
- add support for 'push' method (up, down, left, right) if text content is is too big for container & runs over: this would push all other surrounding content so that longer text fits / other surrounding elements can accommodate the extra space needed

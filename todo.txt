Group tasks:

- JS handling:
> (done) trigger JS on window load event not working
> resizing the browser causes elements to offset that cause jank, so elements aren't exactly placed

- fonts / text:
> (done) line height issues on scaling
> add support for min/max font size scaling
> convert Figma's "Vertical trim Cap height" into CSS

- boxes
> add support to auto-scale the font size to fit text within a fixed width & fixed height box
> add support for 'push' method (up, down, left, right) if text content is is too big for container & runs over: this would push all other surrounding content so that longer text fits / other surrounding elements can accommodate the extra space needed

- images
> (done) need to auto add in some CSS props as Figma does not export this

- list items


Notes:
- example 1: boxes & text (no images)
- example 2: images & text
- example 3: image grid

Usage notes:
- text elements need a text box container parent

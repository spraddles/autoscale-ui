Group tasks:

- CSS file parsing
> (done) add position: absolute
> fix 'example-1/desktop.css' not parsing

- fonts / text:
> (done) line height issues on scaling
> add support for min/max font size scaling
> convert Figma's "Vertical trim Cap height" into CSS (is this related to line height?)

- boxes
> add support to auto-scale the font size to fit text within a fixed width & fixed height box
> add support for 'push' method (up, down, left, right) if text content is is too big for container & runs over: this would push all other surrounding content so that longer text fits / other surrounding elements can accommodate the extra space needed

- images
> need to auto add in some CSS props as Figma does not export this:
element.style.position = 'absolute'
element.style.backgroundSize = 'cover'
element.style.backgroundRepeat = 'no-repeat'
element.style.backgroundPosition = 'center center'

- list items

- grids


Notes:
- example 1: boxes & text (no images)
- example 2: images & text
- example 3: image grid

Usage notes:
- text elements need a text box parent

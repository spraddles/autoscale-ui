Group tasks:

- CSS file parsing
> update fontPropsArray to check every item in array, not any

- fonts / text:
> add support for min/max font size scaling

- boxes
> add support to auto-scale the font size to fit text within a fixed width & fixed height box
> add support for 'push' method (up, down, left, right) if text content is is too big for container & runs over: this would push all other surrounding content so that longer text fits / other surrounding elements can accommodate the extra space needed

-auto-identify element type by CSS props
(e.g. if 'font-size' or 'text-align' then its text!)

- images

- list items

- grids


Notes:
- example 1: boxes & text (no images)
- example 2: images & text
- example 3: image grid

Usage notes:
- text elements need a text box parent

Issues:
-some nodes dont have postion info (shape-2, shape-3)





Examples:
- example 1: boxes & text (no images)
- example 2: image & text
- example 3: image grid




Figma notes:
-on select of node, calculate the position values from the parent (container) [traverse up/down the nodelist to calculate values]

-if Top or Left values are missing, traverse up the nodelist to get the missing value from the nearest parent

-on rearranging the nodes visually, the position values can be recalculated
-(then in UI if child is moved into a parent then recalculate position values)
-auto determine z-index by node position in nodesArray
-if shape doens't have color traverse down nodelist until nearest color is found (use this color)
-P tags need a text box container parent
- boxes:
> add support to auto-scale the font size to fit text within a fixed width & fixed height box
> add support for 'push' method (up, down, left, right) if text content is is too big for container & runs over: this would push all other surrounding content so that longer text fits / other surrounding elements can accommodate the extra space needed
-figma bug: text & shape colors: if text, then color. if shape, then background color (sometimes this gets mixed up)
-line height in Figma doesn't work in some text (e.g. "AB")


Notes:
-in Figma "frames" are parents / group items

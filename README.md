### Why would I need this?
If you want your websites to look exactly like the Figma (or other UX) specification, this repo can help you achieve that.

### Who is this for?
This is for those who like absolute'ly positioned design elements, meaning, no dynamically positioned HTML elements (like Flex or Grid, etc.).

### What does it do?
This function will receive all your absolutely positioned elements from a fixed width & height and autoscale them to fit the viewport width / height etc.

### But does it really work?
Yes my friend, it works beautifully :-)
